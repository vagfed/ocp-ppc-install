# 
# Network configuration for the LPAR
#

# This must be the IP address of the current server.
# This machine will be configured as BOOTP, TFTP, HTTP server serving installation
pxe_server: 172.17.227.57

# Network configuration of nodes. All LPARs are assumed to belong to the same network.
# You can use https://www.calculator.net/ip-subnet-calculator.html
# In the sample the LPAR has IP 172.17.227.58/19
# - subnet is the network address (19 bits if IP) --> 172.17.224.0
# - netmask is the subnet mask --> 255.255.224.0
netmask: 255.255.224.0    # netmask of LPARs
subnet: 172.17.224.0      # subnet name of LPARs (calculate with https://www.calculator.net/ip-subnet-calculator.html)
gateway: 172.17.224.1     # default gateway

# Name server to use
nameserver: 172.17.224.5
